What is thread ?
Ans). =>   Thread allows  a program to operate effectively by doing
        multiple things at the same time.
      =>    Threads can be used to perform complicated tasks in the
        background without interrupting the main program.

threads can be created in two ways 
     => By extending thread class and overriding it's run method()

     example:-
                 class A extends thread {
                   public void run(){
                        System.out.println("This code is running in a Thread");
                   }
                 }

    => By imeplementing Runnable interface method run()
    
     example :- 
                class B implements Runnable{
                   public void run(){
                     System.out.println("This code is running in a thread");
                   }
                }
